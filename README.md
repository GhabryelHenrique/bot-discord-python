Hi, i create this bot for discord to read a news at my university without having to go to her website. 
I intend to create more functionalities how to remember when there will be exams or papers to turn in or perhaps require registration and id to enter the discord channel.
There are still many possibilities and any suggestion is very welcome. 

Libraries: 
Discord.py,
Feedparser,
DateTime,
BeautifulSoup,
Locale,
